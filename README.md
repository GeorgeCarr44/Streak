Streak is a mobile app that was made as a daily habit tracker to learn [.NET Maui](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui) Its inspired by the habit tracker described in James Clears [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)
The premise is that buttons will show for each habit that you would like to complete in each day.
The data is stored locally on the users device using a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.
